Project_Evolve: Created and founded by Padraig Doyle 

Project_Evolve allows you to simply generate new ideas every day to accomplish with the hopes of improving yourself and the world. It is seperated into three different categories which are: random acts of kindness, do something you're afraid of, and do something for yourself. Hitting the generate button will randomly generate three possible ideas per category per day. 

It was created in March of 2015 at General Assembly.
